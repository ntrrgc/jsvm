/**
 * A linked list of instances of this class is used to construct useful accessor chains
 * for {@link InvalidJSValueType} errors.
 *
 * An accessor is either a property or a method, represented in accessorString as "myProp" or
 * "getMyProp()". Traversing these nodes and joining strings backwards allows you to recover
 * access strings like this:
 *
 *  pokedex.pokemon().experience
 *
 * A special kind of node is the root class accessor, which is used to start a chain when the
 * root object does not come from reading a property of the global scope (AKA a global variable).
 * That node has isRootClassNode set to true and its accessorString is the name of the constructor
 * function (AKA class) that created it. When formatted as a path, the root class accessor gets a
 * colon instead of a dot, in order to make clear we're not referring to a global variable.
 *
 *  Pokedex:pokemon().experience
